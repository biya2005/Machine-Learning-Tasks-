    "### Definition: The featyre Enginnering is a process of transfoe=rming the raw data into features that are suitable for the machine learning models. In other models, it is the process in which we extracting , selecting and featuring that data to build more efficient and accurate machine learning models. The featuring enginnering really depends upon the models working. As it is the important process for making the machine more efficient and accurate for the running of the machine learning models. The more model is best fitted the more perfect the model can design the machine more accurate nad efiicient for the up coming the models and the results can be more efficient and progress of the model will be define more efficient. \n",
